# MarathonTimePredicition

Fist Eveyone know about Marathon. It is helpful for physical balance. And then,This Project is based on predict the pace(overall average pace by a race) by 
analysis the speed of the race by 5k,10k,15k,20k,25k,30k,35k,40k.Without using any calculation wecann't finding the athelete distance.Each and Every Second is 
very important for an athelete.

I took DataSet form "Finishers Boston Marathon-2016".This Marathon has held in USA.
To predict the pace and timings of an athlete we can use machine learning algorithm.Predicting race times with such precision will be a challenge.
Large companies such as Nike and Adidas spend a lot of money in sponsorship of athletes.
